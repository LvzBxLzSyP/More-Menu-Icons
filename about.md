Letsgooo you can now change how many icons appear in the main menu!!

Thanks SawbladeGD / redfire07 for the mod idea and for letting me steal it.

# Information

* Destroyed players that were spawned by the mod will not count torwards the "destroyed players" stat.
* The slider in the menu goes from 0 to 100, but you can go higher by setting the value from mod settings.
* You can disable the slider in the menu from mod settings.
* The mod can be laggy at high values so consider lowering it if too laggy :O.
